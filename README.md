# rainbow-art
Some fun rainbow art, which I made with p5.js

run `git clone https://github.com/eli-front/rainbow-art` in your terminal to clone repo.

All pieces are static webpages, but may require a http server due to file privacy settings.

To setup a local server run `python -m http.server 8000` in your terminal (Make sure to use python3)

After setting up the server go to (http://localhost:8000/)[http://localhost:8000/] and locate the rainbow-art directory & the subdirectory of the project you would like to see. ex: http://localhost:8000/path/to/rainbow-art/Rainbow-Bounce-Balls

Note: Google Chrome usually gives the best functionality & frame rate.
