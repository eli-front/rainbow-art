# rainbow-art
Some fun rainbow art, which I made with p5.js

All pieces are static webpages, and do not require a server.

run `git clone https://github.com/eli-front/rainbow-art`.
Navigate to your folder/project of choice and open the index.html file with a browser.

Google Chrome usually gives the best functionality.
